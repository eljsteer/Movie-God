  <h1 align="center">Movie Guide<h1>

## Description

The aim of this project was to create a Movie Guide.
Phase One: Was a focus on allowing users to keep track of upcoming and movies that have recently released and with information on where to watch them.
Phase Two: Was a focus on providing the functionality for the user to be able to rate and review movies. We also gave the user the ability to view which movies they have rated and reviewed.
Phase Three: A future focus for the application will be on providing a watchlist feature where the User is able to add whatever movie they desire and set it to plan to watch or already watched. Planned movies may be set in three tiers of priority: Low, Medium and High. Within those tiers the user will be able to drag and rop the movies into an order of priority. Users will also be able to later on view other users profiles.
